Today I am going to get kicked out of here because of graduating. I really cherish the knowledge, expertise and friendships I got in my college. I think the most important things I learned during these years include：

<ul>
    <li>Ideas don't come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started </li>
    <li>Taking feedback from your environment about your problem sets. We should respond to people as closed-loops and correct our prior assumptions</li>
    <li>Instead of only fighting over what we believe, we need to speak up and forge coalition to create something if it is a significant technology</li>
    <li>Keep the spirit of exploration. Do not let anything hold you back, because imagination is the magic</li>
</ul>

As luck would have it, I am one of the few university students who have experienced sailing on a armed cruising ship. I really enjoyed my time on the sea!

Besides，I made a great bunch of friends while learning and teaching dancing here. I could say it was one of the most important thing I built in my time here. See our dance performance <a href="https://m.youku.com/video/id_XMTI2NDc2OTM0OA==.html?x=&from=timeline&isappinstalled=0&source=&ishttps=1" target="blank">video </a>online. I really love my school!
