Today it is my 25th birthday and I decided to write down something meaningful. I want to thank my roommate Mr. Hu who introduce me to the world of deep learning. He also gave me a lot of advice for my Asian age prediction with CNN project. I have seen many changes in the fields of deep learning and robotics which made me consider a lot for my future career. In celebration of my birthday, I'll give out a book list that includes all the awesome books I've already read regarding DL. Hope it will be helpful for you!

Good luck and god bless!
