I have experience some changes during my PhD program in Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) when I realized the true beauty of artificial intelligence, and that my genuine research interest lay in this fascinating field. I found <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/" target="blank">Prof. Christopher Manning</a> as my new role model in nature language processing. Basically, I seek creativity across the fields of audio-visual cognition, video processing and efficient deep neural networks.
I have enjoyed studying and working in NPU for the past 18 months and appreciate the knowledge and experience I have gained.

As luck would have it, during my time in college, I also met my best friend Carol who studied in Sichuan University, a talented girl with expertise in many languages including English, Japanese and Korean.
