I am a research assistant of [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://www.nwpu.edu.cn){:target="\_blank"}. My research interests focus on temporal information processing. Currently, I am looking for a graduate program in United Kingdom. I have become increasingly interested in natural language processing with self-attention mechanism and dialogue system. Specifically, I seek creativity across the fields of visual dialogue system, video processing and efficient deep neural networks. I am a student member of IEEE. I am a life-long learner, and always willing to share my problems with others and create something new together.
I got my MEng degree at [Shanghai Maritime University](https://www.shmtu.edu.cn/){:target="\_blank"} where I carried out several researches about computer vision measurement and multi-agents controllers. Recently, I have grown a huge interest in deep learning. See my projects at <a href="https://pengbohua.github.io/Pengbohua/projects/">projects pages</a>.

In my leisure time, I am a student mentor of on-campus Latin club. My favorite dance is Chachacha!
As a member of NPU UAV club, I also like playing around with robotics very much.
