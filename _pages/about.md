I am a second-year PhD candidate of the School of Automation at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://www.nwpu.edu.cn){:target="\_blank"}. My research interests focus on temporal information processing. Currently, I am looking for a graduate program in England. I have become increasingly interested in self-attention mechanism and visual tracking using attention. I seek creativity across the fields of visual dialogue system, video processing and efficient deep neural networks. I am a student member of IEEE. Feel free to take a look at my papers in [publications page](/BohuaPeng/publications/)

I got my MEng degree at [Shanghai Maritime University](https://www.shmtu.edu.cn/){:target="\_blank"} where I carried out several researches about computer vision measurement and multi-agents controllers. Recently, I have grown a huge interest in end-to-end learning. See my projects at [projects page](/BohuaPeng/projects/).

In my leisure time, I am a student mentor of on-campus Latin club. My favorite dance is Chachacha!
As a member of NPU UAV club, I also like playing around with robotics very much.
